## 9ssi7 Lab

This repository serves as a playground for experimentation and development of various tools and libraries in Go. It leverages Git's submodules functionality to centrally manage smaller, focused projects within a single codebase. 

The key benefits of this approach include:

* **Improved Code Organization:** By utilizing submodules, the codebase remains organized and modular, with each project having its own dedicated directory.
* **Version Control and Collaboration:** Each submodule can be independently version-controlled, allowing for easier tracking of changes and collaboration on specific projects.
* **Reusable Components:** Well-tested and maintained submodules can be easily integrated into other projects, promoting code reuse and reducing development time.
